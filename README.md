# SkeletonRunner

Skeleton Runner is a simple game made with Unreal Engine. The player has to run away from the Lich, whose velocity increases over time. Players also have to watch out for pumpkins, which cause a loss of life when collided with. <br />
<br />
In the project, platforms are randomly spawned and I have used the Enhanced Input System.

Below are screenshots from the gameplay:
